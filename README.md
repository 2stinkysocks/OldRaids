# OldRaids

**Important: Mojang changed how raid spawn locations are calculated in 1.21.3+, breaking this plugin and most raid farm designs. This plugin will not work on these versions!**

A lightweight spigot plugin that reverts raid behavior to before 1.21, allowing old raid farms to work the same as before.

### Configuration

```
# allow bStats metrics
metrics: true

# should raid captains still drop ominous bottles (on top of giving bad omen)
raidersDropOminousBottles: false
```

### Commands

```
/oldraids reload
  - Reload the plugin configuration
```
